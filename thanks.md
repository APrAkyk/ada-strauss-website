# Acknowledgement 

We would like to thank [Manoel Ribeiro](https://manoelhortaribeiro.github.io/) for his helpful remarks. We were able to successfully complete this project with his guidance and the data that he kindly shared with us. <br>  
His paper was also very helpful to understand the data we were working on :  
[YouNiverse: Large-Scale Channel and Video Metadatafrom English-Speaking YouTube](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18125/17928)

# Credentials

YouNiverse dataset : [Youniverse](https://zenodo.org/record/4650046#.Y3eNQceZO3-)

Paper of Ribeiro was very helpful to understand the data we were working on : 
[YouNiverse: Large-Scale Channel and Video Metadatafrom English-Speaking YouTube](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18125/17928)

Paper used to calculate the local clustering coefficient computing for the clustering : 
[Directed clustering in weighted networks: A new perspective](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S096007791730509X?via%3Dihub)

We use a server to be able compute of the large amount of data from the YouNiverse dataset : [Server](https://www.vultr.com/)
