# Introduction

As reported by the New York Times Magazine in 2017, YouTube has become "the new Conservative talk radio" for the far right. Moreover, in 2019, Kevin Roose depicted "countless" stories of young men, looking for direction or distraction on YouTube, ending up "seduced by a community of far-right creators". The existence of a radicalization pipeline on Youtube was strongly suggested by the study “Auditing Radicalization Pathways on Youtube”, by Ribeiro et al. (2020). 
From there, we would like to enlarge the scope of this research by studying the toxicity of the comments and the co-commenting activities in far right channel videos.
